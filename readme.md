## General Info
This is a Todo Application made to learn how TypeScript works 
with React. It's very simple template to work and learn.

It contains state with registered users, and field form to add new user.

App.tsx is main component of the application. It contains children components as AddToList and List.
I have used types of react and passed props, also function components and interfaces that I passed throught components. You can simply add new user.
